# YOLOv3-Object-Detection

Steps to follow:
1. Download weights from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights and place into the 'weights' folder.
2. Execute convert_weights.py (You'll require to do this step only once).
3. Execute video.py .
On executing video.py, the object detection using webcam will take place.

This is an implementation of YOLOv3 object detection which has been trained using Microsoft's COCO dataset using Tensorflow.
